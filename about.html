                        <p class="hero-info__text">Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999,
                            highlighting stories of coffee from
                            around the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew
                            - in
                            every shipment.</p>

                    <p class="commitment-info__text">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good
                        along the way. We want to make it
                        easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source.
                        To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to
                        understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with
                        exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well above
                        fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in
                        coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting
                        profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

                        harvest and processing, we
                        employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the
                        coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to
                        roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
